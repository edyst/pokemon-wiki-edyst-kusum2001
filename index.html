            <p id="poki-para1">Pokémon is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo and
               The Pokémon Company as part of the Pokémon media franchise.
               Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from Ken Sugimori,the first games released in 1996 in Japan
               for the Game Boy, and the main series of role-playing video games (RPGs), also referred as the "core
               series" by their developers

                  <p>Water is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire and Grass,
                     which constitute the three starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type
                     concept easily
                     to new players. Water is the most common type with over 100 Pokémon, which are based on a wide
                     variety of fish
                     and other sea-dwelling creatures.</p>

                     types are
                     notoriously rare in the early stages of the games so choosing the Fire variation starter is often a
                     plus.</p>

                  <p class="p_in_statics">The AR game's potential for weight loss was a big part of that discussion. In
                     the process of getting out their doors and visiting parks, players found they were losing
                     weight almost in spite of themselves. A Reddit Pokémon Go fan
                     won acclaim for reporting that he'd lost 65 pounds between July and December.

                     it was in 2016, the game remains incredibly popular.</p>

            <h2>Q and A</h2>
            <p>Questions Every Pokemon Trainer should be able to answer</p>

            <ol class="orderList">

               <li>What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?
                  <ul class="unorderList" style="list-style-type:circle;">
                     <li>We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge of
                        Pikachu is
                        essential for every trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent's evolutionary
                        chain. Pikachu, mighty as
                        it is, has an even stronger evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts of electricity.
                        Maybe you've bumped into
                        this species in the wild. Either way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers should be able to
                        answer.</li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Answer is Raichu
                     </li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>What's the most effective Poke Ball in the game?</li>
               <ul class="unorderList" style="list-style-type:circle;">
                  <li>Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off with, but
                     progressive upgrades
                     are needed if you're looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild Pokemon who emerge in later
                     routes. If you've
                     made your way through any Pokemon game, you've reached the point where you're presented with the
                     most effective
                     Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch,
                     and no button mashing at all is required.</li>
                  <li>Answer is Master Ball</li>

                     Pokémon battles appear in most forms of

                     as well as being a constant focus of the anime.

                  <p>
                     Pokémon Go's Types are exactly the same
                     as those in the main Pokémon games, but
                     the effect of those type matchups is slightly
                     different: in brief, things like effective or
                     resisted attacks have slightly different multipliers to the main
                     Pokémon games -although a December 2018 update brought
                     them slightly closer in line.
